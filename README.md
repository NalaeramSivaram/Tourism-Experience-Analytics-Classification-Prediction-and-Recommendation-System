# Tourism-Experience-Analytics-Classification-Prediction-and-Recommendation-System
**Description:**
              This project focuses on enhancing the tourism experience through intelligent data-driven solutions. It involves three key components:

**Tourism Rating Prediction** –       Predicting user ratings for tourist destinations based on historical transaction and user data using regression techniques.

**Visit Mode Classification** –       Classifying the mode of visit (e.g., solo, family, group) using machine learning classification models.

**Place Recommendation System** –     Suggesting personalized tourist destinations based on user preferences and past behaviors.

The project utilizes MySQL for data management, Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn) for data processing and modeling, and Power Streamlit for interactive visualization and user interface. It aims to assist tourism platforms and users in making smarter travel decisions by combining predictive analytics with recommendation systems.
